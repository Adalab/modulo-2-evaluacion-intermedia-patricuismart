# Web page with a "Guess the number" game.

This repository includes the intermediate eva luation of module 2 of the intensive front-end programming course taught at Adalab.

# How to play:
Choose a random number and try guess the  random number! 

The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to
guess it. The game gives clues as to whether the number it tests is too high or too low, and it counts the number
number of attemps. Until at the end the player hits the number.


Steps to perform the following functionalities from JavaScript:
1. Create a minimal layout with the input, the button, the space for tracks and the space for the attempt counter.
2. Generate a random number with the help of Math.random and Math.ceil. You can use this code.
To do this, copy these 3 lines of code in your JS and do not modify them:
function getRandomNumber (max) {
return Math.ceil (Math.random () * max);
}
3. Show the random number generated in the console to be able to know what number has been generated and to be able to do tests.
4. By pressing the Test button, access the content of the input and display it on the console.
5. Compare the number that the player has written in the input with the random number, and paint the clues corresponding on the screen.
6. Update the attempt counter each time the player tries.
